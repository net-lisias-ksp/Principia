Most KSP mods consist of some CLR DLLs that get loaded by KSP. Principia has most of its logic (in particular, all the numerical analysis) in a native library (`ksp_plugin/`) compiled from C++14, which is called from the C♯ layer (`ksp_plugin_adapter/`) via a P/Invoke interface. That interface is, for the most part, generated by a custom code generator (`tools/`) from protocol buffer descriptors (`serialization/journal.proto`). Those descriptors allow for journalling of anything crossing the interface; this is used for profile-guided optimization as well as debugging.

For serialization (saves), the C++ objects are serialized using protocol buffers (see the `.proto` files in `serialization/`), and the protocol buffer binary format is then written as a sequence of hexadecimal strings to the KSP save.

The rest of the codebase is mostly a series of C++14 template libraries, which come with their tests. Roughly in topological order,
- `base/` contains general utilities.
- `quantities/` is a strongly-typed library for physical quantities. The implementation uses `binary64` (`double`) floating-point in SI units, but this is not exposed to the user, who explicitly multiplies or divides by units. Angles are dimensionful to obviate confusion between degrees and radians. Strongly-typed elementary functions are provided.
- `geometry/` deals with geometrical concepts useful for classical physics: strongly-typed `Vector`s of some `Quantity` with a strongly-typed dependency on the reference frame, a distinction between `Vector`s and `Bivector`s (also known as pseudovectors), a distinction between `Vector`s and `Point`s (which live an affine space). It provides abstractions for changes of coordinates between reference frames (`Rotation`, `OrthogonalMap`, `Permutation`).  Vector quantities useful for classical physics are named, e.g., [`Position`, `Velocity`, `AngularVelocity`](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/blob/master/geometry/named_quantities.hpp)...
- `numerics/` provides various numerical utilities, with enough templatization to work with the aforementioned types. This contains some code with precomputed matrices generated by a Mathematica notebook.
- `integrators/` focuses specifically on numerical integration.
- `physics/` provides libraries to deal with a physical system under the influence of gravity: abstractions for bodies, trajectories, ephemerides, and reference frames defined from the bodies in the physical system, as well as some support for Kepler orbits and Jacobi coordinates.
- `astronomy/` contains libraries and data that have to do with the real world: our solar system, our timescales (support for date literals in TT, TAI, UT1, and UTC, where the type `Instant` counts TT). Time scale handling involves code generated from IERS tables by an awk script. Moreover, `astronomy/` contains high-level tests of the above libraries for real-life astronomical scenarii: precession of the perihelion of Mercury, lunar eclipses...

In addition,
- `benchmarks/` contains benchmarks using (a fork of) https://github.com/google/benchmark/,
- `benchmark_automation/` is a C♯ utility used to run the benchmarks and parse their output,
- `coverage_analyser/` is a C♯ utility that interprets the output of the instrumented tests to yield coverage statistics,
- `stacktrace_decoder/` is a C♯ utility used to turn logs containing stack trace addresses and the DLL base address into [something usable](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/issues/896#issue-135074672).
