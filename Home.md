Welcome to the Principia wiki!

Before using the mod we recommend that you read the [concepts](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts) document which explains how Principia differs from stock KSP.

We have a tutorial explaining how to go to the Mun with Principia and the stock game [here](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/A-guide-to-going-to-the-Mun-with-Principia).

The FAQ on installing, reporting bugs and generally making the best use of Principia can be found [here](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Installing,-reporting-bugs,-and-frequently-asked-questions).

The change log is [here](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Change-Log).
