Before using the mod we recommend that you read the [concepts](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts) document which explains the most important parts of Principia.  In particular, you should learn about the [plotting frame](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts#plotting-frame) and [flight planning](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts#flight-planning).

INSTALL: Download the binary (Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows) [HERE](https://goo.gl/w3VKtA) or, if you don't trust our binary, build the mod from the Cayley release.

If you try to design your own solar system, e.g., using Kopernicus, you should be aware that the Jool system is unstable in the stock game and read our [analysis of its stability](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/On-the-dynamical-stability-of-Principia's-modified-Jool-system). 

For those interested about how things work behind the scenes, we recommend looking at the [technical overview](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Technical-Overview) to understand the overall structure of the project.
