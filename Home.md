To install the mod, download the binaries for Ubuntu, macOS and Windows using the links found in the [README](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/blob/master/README.md) file.  KSP versions 1.5.1, 1.6.1 and 1.7.x are supported.

Before using the mod we recommend that you read the [concepts](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts) document which explains the most important parts of Principia.  In particular, you should learn about the [plotting frame](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts#plotting-frame) and [flight planning](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Concepts#flight-planning).

You might also want to go through our
[tutorial](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/A-guide-to-going-to-the-Mun-with-Principia) which shows how 
to go to the Mun with Principia in an energy-efficient manner.

The [FAQ](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Installing,-reporting-bugs,-and-frequently-asked-questions) explain how to install, how to report bugs and documents the known issues and limitations.

The [change log](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Change-Log) gives a fairly detailed description of the new features in each release.

If you try to design your own solar system, e.g., using Kopernicus, you should be aware that the Jool system is unstable in the stock game and read our [analysis of its stability](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/On-the-dynamical-stability-of-Principia's-modified-Jool-system).  We have a detailed description of the [configuration files](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Principia-configuration-files) that describe the gravity model, the initial state and the numerics parameters for a custom-made solar system.

For those interested about how things work behind the scenes, we recommend looking at the [technical overview](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Technical-Overview) to understand the overall structure of the project.

We also expose an [API](https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia/wiki/Interface-for-other-KSP-mods) to allow other mods to take Principia's effects into account.
