The orbit analysis tool provides information about the current trajectory, seen as a perturbed Kepler orbit.

## Overview

The orbit analysis tool analyses the current trajectory of the active vessel, as an orbit around the body selected in the `Plotting frame selection` window. The trajectory is analysed over a given mission duration. 

The computation occurs in the background; it is tracked by a progress bar.

Below the progress bar is the orbit analysis report from the last computation.

### Periods

Three periods are given.

- The sidereal period is the period of the mean longitude Ω+ω+M. 
- The nodal period is the period of the mean argument of latitude ω+M. This approximately corresponds to the time between successive ascending nodes.
- The anomalistic period is the period of the mean anomaly M. This approximately corresponds to the time between successive periapsides.
